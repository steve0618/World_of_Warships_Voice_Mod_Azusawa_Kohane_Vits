Hello﻿ captains! Today, I would like to suggest my MOD "Azusawa Kohane Voice MOD".﻿

Who is Azusawa Kohane?

Azusawa Kohane(小豆沢 こはね) is the debut character of "Project SEKAI Colorful Stage! feat. Hatsune Miku"(プロジェクトセカイ カラフルステージ! feat. 初音﻿﻿﻿ミク) and its derivative works.
She is enrolled in Class 1A of Miyazaka Girls' Academy and is a member of Vivid BAD SQUAD. She likes to eat longevity peach buns and sesame dumplings, but doesn't like cold dishes mixed with vinegar. She is a very shy girl who has no confidence in herself.
One day, in a coffee music bar that happened to pass by, she saw Shiraishi An and ﻿other performers performing. Her knowledge﻿ of music was limited to school music lessons, she was shocked by the rap and intense rhythm music that she had never heard before, and was captured by the charm of such rap music.

Demonstration:

There's totally 87 modifications to the original
